# Testing Plan & Success Criteria

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests
- JSON parsing
- Test generation
- Request handling
- Authentication
- Folder structure handling
- Name resolution (Postman folder/test names)
- Dependency visualization:
  * Fixture relationship mapping
  * Environment variable detection
  * Test method dependency chains
  * Output formatting

### Integration Tests
- Full conversion process
- Test execution
- Basic error cases
- Directory structure verification
- Name-based target resolution
- Dry run functionality:
  * Compare output with postman_dependency_graph
  * Verify fixture relationships
  * Check environment variable detection
  * Test with various target options

## Success Criteria

### Input Processing
1. Can successfully parse both dependency YML and collection JSON
2. Extracts correct request details from collection
3. Variable dependencies are correctly identified

### Test Generation
4. Generates properly ordered pytest files
5. Variable sharing works correctly through fixtures
6. Test dependencies are properly managed
7. Generated tests can be executed with pytest
8. Variable scoping and cleanup works correctly

### Structure & Organization
9. Clear and organized test structure
10. Output directory structure matches collection structure
11. Folder exclusions work correctly for both inputs

### CLI Functionality
12. Both --target and --name options work correctly
13. Error handling works as expected
14. Help documentation is clear and complete
15. Dry run output matches postman_dependency_graph format
16. Dependency visualization shows correct relationships
17. Environment variables are properly identified
18. Fixture chains match generated test structure

## Next Steps
After MVP completion, move to Phase 2:
- Support for multiple target endpoints
- Enhanced variable type support
- Variable transformation functions
- Automatic test assertion generation
- Support for test parameterization

## Quality Metrics
- Test coverage > 90%
- All unit tests pass
- All integration tests pass
- No critical security issues
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- Code follows project style guidelines
- Dry run output matches reference tool
